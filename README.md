# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This is part of the ongoing Kaggle competition [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. 

## Approach

Using extensive data preprocessing techniques, a logistic regression model is trained on the training set and tested on the test set.

Some of the techniques include:
- Handling missing values
- Feature engineering
- One-hot encoding
- Normalization
- Standardization
- Whitening
- PCA
- Feature selection

This approach currently achieves a 79.425% accuracy on the test set and is ranked 1,000 out of 15,000 people.
